1.0b25 (2018-12-14)
===================

- The `TargetPixelFile.interact()` bokeh app now includes a `Save Lightcurve` button [#329].

- Fixed a minor bug in `LightCurve.bin()` [#377].



1.0b24 (2018-12-10)
===================

- Added support for TESS to `search_targetpixelfile()` and `search_lightcurvefile()`  [#367].

- Added support for data generated by the `TESScut service <https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/>`_ [#369, #375].

- Removed "Impulsive outliers" from the default set of quality constraints applied to TESS data [#374].

- `LightCurve.flatten()` is now more robust against outliers [#372].

- `LightCurve.fold()` now takes a `transit_midpoint` parameter instead of the `phase` parameter [#361, #363].

- Various minor bugfixes [#372].



1.0b23 (2018-11-30)
===================

- `TargetPixelFile.create_threshold_mask()` now only returns one contiguous mask, which is configurable using the new `reference_pixel` argument [#345].

- `TargetPixelFile.interact()`: now requires Bokeh v1.0 or later [#355].

- `utils.detect_filetype()` automatically detects Kepler or TESS Target Pixel Files and Light Curve files [#340, #350, #356].

- `LightCurve.estimate_cdpp()`: the argument `sigma_clip` was renamed into `sigma` [#359].

- Fixed minor bugs in `LightCurve.to_pandas()` [#343], `LightCurve.correct()` [#347], `FoldedLightCurve.errorbar()` [#352], `LightCurve.fold()` [#353].

- Documentation improvements [#344, #358].

- Increased the unit test coverage [#351].



1.0b22 (2018-11-17)
===================

- `lightkurve.open()` was added to provide a single function to read in any light curve or target pixel file from Kepler or TESS and return the appropriate object [#317].

- The `from_fits()` methods have been deprecated in favor of `lightkurve.open()` [#336].

- The `lightkurve.mast` module has been removed in favor of the new `lightkurve.search` module.

- Various small bugfixes, speed-ups, and documentation improvements [#314, #315, #322, #323, #325, #331, #334, #335].



1.0b21 (2018-10-29)
===================

- The `from_archive()` methods of `KeplerTargetPixelFile` and `KeplerLightCurveFile` have been deprecated in favor of the new `search_targetpixelfile()` and `search_lightcurvefile()` functions.  These allow users to inspect the results of their queries and offer more powerful features, e.g. cone-searches.  If you are currently using `tpf = KeplerTargetPixelFile.from_archive("objectname")`, please start using `tpf = search_targetpixelfile("objectname").download()` instead.

- `TargetPixelFile` objects can now be indexed and sliced. [#308]

- The default number of `windows` used by the SFF systematics removal algorithm has been changed from 1 to 10. [#312]

- Various small bug fixes and unit test improvements.



1.0b20 (2018-10-16)
===================

- We adopted a rule that all method names must include a verb, and all class properties must be a noun [#286].  As a result, we renamed the following methods:
  * `LightCurve.cdpp()` is now `LightCurve.estimate_cdpp()`
  * `LightCurve.periodogram()` is now `LightCurve.to_periodogram()`
  * `LichtCurve.properties()` is now `LightCurve.show_properties()` 
  * `TargetPixelFile.aperture_photometry()` is now `TargetPixelFile.extract_aperture_photometry()`
  * `TargetPixelFile.centroids()` is now `TargetPixelFile.estimate_centroids()`
  * `TargetPixelFile.header()` is now a property.

- Added `Periodogram.smooth()` [#288].

- `Periodogram.estimate_snr()` was renamed to `Periodogram.p.flatten()` [#290].

- Lightkurve can now read in light curve files produced using `LightCurveFile.to_fits()` [#297].



1.0b19 (2018-10-10)
===================

- The `Periodogram` class has been refactored;

- The `LightCurve.remove_outliers()` method now accepts `sigma_lower` and `sigma_upper` parameters.
