Advanced lightkurve
===================

In the previous sections we covered basics and some common tasks to work with your data. In these tutorials we will look into some advanced uses of lightkurve.

In the first tutorial, we will recreate the self flat fielding technique used in Vanderburg 2014 to remove K2 spacecraft motion. This will show in more detail how to use the `lightkurve.LightCurve.correct()` function to remove motion.
